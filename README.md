# A QUICK RESPONSE(QR) CODE ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This was the project for my final year. An attendance system that uses QR technology to manage attendance.

# How It Works

Lecturers generate the code on a screen and students enter and scan the code in the set window of time set by the lecturer. A successful scan send present to the system and otherwise sends absent. It also uses geofencing to ensure students are in the class when they are scanning. If they arent it does not scan but if they are it scans.

# To Setup
1. Download the zip file or clone to your code editor
2. Download node if your system does not have it and install
3. In your code editors terminal, Move to the directory of the folder named client/test and run npm install --legacy-peer-deps
4. Once it is complete, Run npm start.
   <br>For the backend;
1. Move to the folder named backend/ and run npm install in the new terminal(One for the frontend and one for the backend).
2. Once all files have installed, Open your xampp or backend manager and connect it to the backend.
3. Once finished, Run npm run dev.
